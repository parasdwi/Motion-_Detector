# Motion-Detector
Developed a real-time motion detector using Python, which processes live video input to identify and highlight moving objects with bounding boxes. When motion is detected, the system captures the image and automatically sends it to the user's email. Technologies used include OpenCV for video processing and image recognition, and smtplib for email notifications.
